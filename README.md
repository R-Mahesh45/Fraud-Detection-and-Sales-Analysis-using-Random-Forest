# Fraud Detection and Sales Analysis using Random Forest

## Overview  
This project focuses on building machine learning models using Random Forest and other ensemble methods for two key tasks:  
1. **Fraud Detection**: Classify individuals as "Risky" or "Good" based on taxable income.  
2. **Sales Analysis**: Analyze the attributes that contribute to high sales for a cloth manufacturing company.  

Random Forest is utilized as the primary algorithm, along with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM for comparison.

## About the Data  

### Fraud Detection Dataset:  
- **Taxable Income**: Used to classify individuals into "Risky" (â‰¤ 30000) or "Good".  
- Additional attributes include: age, work class, education, occupation, and more.  

### Sales Dataset:  
- **Target Variable**: `Sales` (categorized as High/Low based on threshold values).  
- **Features**: Includes Competitor Price, Income, Advertising, Population, Price, Shelf Location, Age, Education, Urban, and US.

## Project Features  
- **Fraud Detection**:  
  - Classification using Random Forest.  
  - Ensemble methods including Bagging and Voting Classifiers.  
  - Evaluation using cross-validation.

- **Sales Analysis**:  
  - Random Forest model to identify key factors contributing to sales.  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis to derive insights.

## Modeling Techniques  
1. **Fraud Detection**:  
   - Random Forest Classifier to label individuals as "Risky" or "Good".  
   - Ensemble Voting Classifier with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM.  
   - Cross-validation to evaluate performance.  

2. **Sales Analysis**:  
   - Random Forest to analyze features impacting high sales.  
   - Categorized `Sales` into High and Low.

## Results  
### Fraud Detection:  
- Cross-validation results:  
  ```
  array([1.        , 0.98333333, 0.96666667, 0.93333333, 1.        ,
         1.        , 0.98333333, 0.98333333, 1.        , 1.        ])
  ```
- Mean accuracy: **98.5%**

### Sales Analysis:  
- Cross-validation results:  
  ```
  array([0.125, 0.1  , 0.125, 0.225, 0.2  , 0.175, 0.225, 0.075, 0.125, 0.15 ])
  ```
- Mean accuracy: **15.25%**
